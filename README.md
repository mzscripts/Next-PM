🗳️ Election Outcome Prediction using Machine Learning
Overview:
This project focuses on predicting election outcomes—specifically popular vote share and seats won—based on various socio-political and demographic factors. Using historical data, I developed and evaluated regression models to forecast future electoral performance, enabling data-driven insights for political strategy and decision-making.

Objectives:

Predict popular vote percentages and seats won by parties in an election.

Preprocess complex categorical and numerical features.

Evaluate and compare model performance using proper validation metrics.

Key Features:

📊 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Trimmed inconsistent column names and separated categorical vs. numerical features.

🧠 Modeling: Built predictive pipelines using machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost.

🔍 Hyperparameter Tuning: Implemented parameter grids for model optimization.

📈 Evaluation: Assessed model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) to ensure accurate forecasting.

🔄 Reusable Pipelines: Leveraged scikit-learn's Pipeline and ColumnTransformer for streamlined preprocessing and inference.

Technologies Used:

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

XGBoost

Seaborn & Matplotlib (for visualization)

Outcome:
The project successfully demonstrated a practical application of machine learning to electoral data analysis. The final models provided reasonably accurate predictions and laid a foundation for building a full-scale election analytics dashboard.
